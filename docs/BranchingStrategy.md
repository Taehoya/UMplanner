# Branching Strategy

Our group has followed a basic feature isolation strategy with multiple branches branching off of the master branch. Each branch is meant for 1 feature. There are 1-2 members working on each feature branch. Depending on the work, there might be dev branches branching off of a feature branch. These dev branches have one member each working on them. Branches are merged after a code review by fellow members.

Our branchihng strategy is subject to change in the next iteration due to poor workflow.

Following is an illustration of our branching strategy:
