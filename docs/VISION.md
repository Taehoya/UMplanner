# Vision

UMplanner will work as a course scheduling platform designed to give University of Manitoba students a centralized place to plan their courses for future semesters easily in the palm of their hands. 

Students in University of Manitoba will be able to create and modify a course schedule for any semester of their preference, with the ability to select up to 5 or more courses for each semester. They will be able to see detailed course information including course description and the ability to add the course to the schedule. Therefore, students are not required to go back and forth on Aurora looking for the course. Furthermore, Students can see the required major courses, specialization, and  remaining credits for graduation to plan their schedule more efficiently without checking umAcheive. 

The detailed course information will include the number of credit hours each course holds as well as the prerequisites for a course so that the student knows what courses he/she needs to take before that particular course to reduce any possibility of conflicts. As more students start making schedules, there will be more information available on when students tend to take a particular course during the year.

Completed semesters will also be available for students to view separately. At the end of each semester, the current semester will automatically be considered completed.
For the current semester courses, students will be able to select the course time and will be easily viewable for quick reference. Students can also choose to be able to receive reminders for their classes before they begin.

Students will be able to work on their schedules from any device. Additionally, students will be able to share their plans with each other. Verified graduate students can also make their degree plan out publicly visible which will greatly help new students to plan ahead for their future years at the university. 

UMplanner application is intended to save countless hours spent by students on Aurora and multiple other websites struggling to make a schedule that works for them. It is not easy to find course information for courses from different departments, their availability in different semesters, and the ones students are required to take for their program at one place. As a result of this project, students need to worry less about the courses they need to take in the future.

Since UMplanner is targeting the University of Manitoba Students succeess in thieir academic plan. This project will be considered successful when the 8% (2400 students) of University of Manitoba students are actively using the application to plan their coursework.
