##Retrospective


As a team, we have had quite a few setbacks from both iteration 1 and 2. After pointing out certain setbacks from iteration 1 retrospective we made progress with minor improvements going into iteration 2 but still ended up having the same drawbacks all over again. We decided to approach iteration 3 with a different perspective and handle it with an organized workflow unlike the other two iterations to be able to evaluate a success from it. Below are some of the few things that did not go well therefore has not been as successful as we would have liked in those iterations:
-	Lack of quality code
-	Merging issues
-	Leaving technical debts
-	Incomplete features
-	Poor planning
-	Poor distribution of work<br>
Analyzing these issues, to begin with merging issues we decided that this was caused by the lack of quality code which caused conflicts while merging in iteration 1 and 2. This is also partly the reason why we could not meet our estimated goal for completing three features per iteration since some branches had to be eliminated and leave room for quality coded features. To solve this in iteration three we decided to reuse as much code we could from previous works and make sure to do final checks on the dev branches after merges were done.<br>
Along with lack of quality coding came in technical debts that kept on accumulating in a hurry to get features completed. Only a couple of the members were able to work with the project which slowed down our work progress and to ensure this does not happen again for iteration 3 we are going to discuss and communicate better with the team members and evaluate scenarios and situations that may lead to complications. We will assign issues to team members wisely to not conflict with each otherâ€™s work to not deliberately leave any technical debt behind.<br>
As we noticed these issues were interlinked and all these led to incomplete features which set us back from our estimates.<br>
Lastly since this is the fourth iteration, we have better understood issues and tasks each member can handle therefore to avoid confusion after the planning stages we have decided to set deadlines in between and add frequent meet-ups to clear out any confusions in planning and distributing work for iteration 3.
